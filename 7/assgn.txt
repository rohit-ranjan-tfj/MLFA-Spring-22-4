1) Drop the redundant columns. 

2) Drop the rows containing missing values.

3) Using this data implement following regression techniques from scratch without using any library function.

    Linear Regression
    Lasso Regression
    Ridge Regression

4) Give the comparative analysis of all these regression techniques.
